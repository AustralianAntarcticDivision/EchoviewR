### Installing EchoviewR
Currently, ```EchoviewR``` has quite a few dependencies, something we are hoping to rectify.  Meanwhile, you will need to install the following ```R``` packages:

```sp```,```geosphere```,```maptools```,```RDCOMClient``` and ```lubridate```
  
You can install all these packages with the following  ```R``` code:

```{r dependPacks,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('sp','geosphere','maptools','RDCOMClient','lubridate'))
```

If ```RDCOMClient``` fails try:
```{r dependPacks, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("omegahat/RDCOMClient")
```

If the install still fails because of ```Rtools``` go to [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/] and install the latest version of ```Rtools```. Once Rtools is installed, you have to restart RStudio and then install ```RDCOMClient``` before proceeding to install ```EchoviewR```.

You are then ready to install the ```EchoviewR``` package directly from github using ```devtools``` (Wickham & Chang, 2016):


```{r install,eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools",quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("devtools")
 devtools::install_github('AustralianAntarcticDivision/EchoviewR')
```

NB if you would like the older ```EchoviewR``` version (v1.0) that was used during the 2017 meeting of the CCAMLR Subgroup on Acoustics, Survey and Analysis Methods, please use the following code:

```{r installASAM,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('AustralianAntarcticDivision/EchoviewR',ref='v1.0')
```

You should then be ready to work with EchoviewR:
```{r startEVR, eval=FALSE}
library(EchoviewR)
```

### Getting started

We are currently updating the ```EchoviewR``` vignettes.  Once available, the vignettes will use data available at the Australian Antarctic Division Data Centre [doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/15/54CF081FB955F].
